# streams

This work originated at Standford and is described in the paper [The CQL Continuous Query Language: Semantic Foundations and Query Execution](http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/758/1/2003-67.pdf)

The code has been downloaded from the Standford's web-site, the project has been closed in 2006.

I am going to try to resurrect it, first by creating some test harness, then by modernising the C++, and learning the code along the way. Then, perhaps, I will have some ideas about where to take it further.
